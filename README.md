# No-Free Lunch Web Application

The No-Free Lunch theorem in Machine Learning states that “ No Particular Classifier can outperform all the other classifiers for every dataset”, This Project helps in aiding the process of making the lunch free for anyone with a dataset. This project aims to reduce the development time and enhance the productivity of the user, also this project facilitates No-Code Machine Learning i.e allowing the end user to model their data with no need for a single line of Code.
